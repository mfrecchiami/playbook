title: Interacting with mentors
---

While mentors are responsible for the success of the individual team member, team leads are
responsible for the success of their teams and clients. They coordinate team members who work on a
project, handle communication with clients and help them scope and prioritize the product backlog so
that the development team can work without interruption. This separation of powers ensures that our
client's interests never trump the team's needs, while also providing clients with the assurance
that someone is looking after them.

When working as a team lead, it is important that you know how to interact with your team's mentors.
While you are strongly encouraged to provide micro-feedback frequently and directly to the team, you
should talk to a team member's mentor about any large or recurring issues that affect the team
member's performance or day-to-day work. The mentor will be able to tackle the issue during 1:1s and
other ceremonies and will talk to you to monitor the team member's progress.
