title: Running one-on-ones
---

The tricky thing about one-on-ones is there is no right way to do them: every mentor has their 
style, which means two one-on-ones can be different even when they're done in the same company. As a
mentor, you are encouraged to find your unique style and voice.

With that said, there are some ground rules to follow for holding effective one-on-ones (i.e.
one-one-ones where people say what they want to say rather than what the manager wants to hear):

- **It's about them, not you.** Even though the mentor schedules them, a one-on-one is about the
  mentee, not the mentor. Let them define the agenda or not have an agenda at all, and let them
  talk about whatever they want.
- **Be interested and show it.** Your main job during a one-on-one is to be genuinely interested in
  what the other person is saying, and to dig deeper and deeper until you are sure all the topics
  have been discussed exhaustively. 
- **Do not reschedule.** You should avoid rescheduling a one-on-one like the plague. Of course,
  we're humans and things happen, so if you absolutely need to, go ahead and reschedule the meeting
  as close as possible to the original date. 
- **Create accountability.** It is extremely important for every one-on-one where problems have been
  raised to create an action plan. Make sure both you and your mentee are accountable for that plan,
  and monitor its progress closely.

One more tip on scheduling the calls: when you have many mentees, it can be tempting to schedule all
of the one-on-ones on Friday, so that the rest of your week is free to do other work. However, as
these meetings are very demanding, it is hard to really focus on more than one or two in the same
day. Instead, try to spread them out throughout the week, so that you can give the same level of
attention to the same one-on-one.
